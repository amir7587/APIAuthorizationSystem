# APIAuthorizationSystem
OVERVIEW
Build a permission based authorization system for API access control.
Users should be able to login using credentials and receive a token. That Authorization token will
be later passed on each API. Create two type of API’s:
1. Public API - Anyone canaccess
2. Private API - Only users having role with a particular permission should be able to access

SPECIFICATIONS

4. Git must be used for version control & all commits must have the same author’s name
& e-mail address as shared with us.
5. Maintain appropriate commit history while working on the project. Submissions with just a
single initial commit will be rejected. Make as many incremental commits as you can while
progressing through the task.
6. The project must be submitted on GitHub as a public repository. Do not mention Ipsator
anywhere in the project. The repository should include a jar builtwith the latest code at
the default location. Include a readme file to specify how to run the project.
